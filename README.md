# Project goals

My first React app!

The first project in Scrimba's Learn React course is this Airbnb clone. The task was to create a mobile version of the site's Experiences page with the goal of learning about the key fundamentals in React.

I expanded on the idea by also making it desktop-friendly and adding more cards and various other elements such as the pop up descriptions.
